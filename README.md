Silly wee AFK project to press a key to stop you appearing inactive on things like Teams or in World of Warcraft

Clone the repro and run the run.exe file

There is a python main.py file that can show the code 

Option one to set the key to press and how often it should be pressed.

Option two starts the thing running and will do so until you close it.

chose to convert to a executable for ease of access no need for any modules to be downloaded etc.

(bit of a rushed job as away from home when hackathon dropped so put together on laptop while traveling)
